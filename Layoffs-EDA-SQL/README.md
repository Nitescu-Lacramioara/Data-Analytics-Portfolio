# SQL Layoffs Exploratory Analysis

This project explores a dataset containing global layoffs using MySQL.
It focuses on understanding patterns, totals, and rankings across years, months, industries, countries, and companies.

### Key Objectives

* Analyze total layoffs by year, month, and country
* Identify top industries and companies by layoffs
* Calculate rolling totals using SQL window functions
* Rank companies and industries using `DENSE_RANK()`
* Draw insights on overall trends and patterns in the dataset

### Tools Used

* MySQL Workbench
* SQL (CTE, Window Functions, GROUP BY, ORDER BY)

### Skills Practiced

* Aggregations (`SUM`, `MAX`, `AVG`, `MIN`)
* Common Table Expressions (`WITH ... AS`)
* Window Functions for cumulative analysis
* Data grouping and ranking techniques

### Context

This is my second mini-project, following the **SQL Data Cleaning Project**, as part of my learning journey toward becoming a Data Analyst.
Both projects are available on my GitHub portfolio.

*This project was inspired by the SQL course by Alex The Analyst on YouTube, which I followed while actively writing and understanding each query step by step.*
