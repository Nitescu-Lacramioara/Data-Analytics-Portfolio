# Data Cleaning Project (SQL)

This project is an educational reproduction of the "SQL Data Cleaning Project" by Alex The Analyst on YouTube.  
I followed the tutorial step-by-step to practice SQL concepts and learn how to clean and prepare data for analysis.

## Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench

## Key Steps and Skills Practiced
1. Identified and removed duplicate records  
2. Standardized inconsistent data formats  
3. Handled null or blank values  
4. Removed unnecessary columns or rows  
5. Used SQL queries such as `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `ALTER TABLE`, and `DELETE` to clean and prepare the dataset  

## Purpose
The main goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of SQL data cleaning techniques and build a strong foundation for more complex data analysis tasks.
